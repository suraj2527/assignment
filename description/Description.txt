Our Page is a simple splash screen having following sub parts:

Main Function: Runs the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.

MyApp: Sets up the MaterialApp with SplashScreen as the home screen and hides the debug banner.

SplashScreen: A StatefulWidget with animations:
           - Initially shows an animated opacity transition for the logo and text.
           - The logo and text fade in after a delay of 500 milliseconds, and their sizes animate accordingly.
           - The font is "lora" is used that is a google font and colors are used as mentioned.

Animation in Splash Screen:
                     - The _visible boolean controls the visibility of the animated widgets and called in initstate.
                     - When the visible is set to true then the content of splash screen fadesin and chances its opacity from 0.0 (invisible) to 1.0 (fully visible) over 1 second.
                     - Initially, the logo and text are invisible but after 500 milliseconds, both the logo's size and the textâ€™s opacity animate into view.
 Thus,the combination of AnimatedOpacity and AnimatedContainer creates a smooth transition effect.

 
HomeScreen: An another screen that displays "Home Screen" in the center.

Timer: After the delay of 3 seconds screen will navigates to the HomePage by using Navigator.PushReplacement.

The splash screen has animated effects for showing and resizing the logo and fading in text.
